# Memory Game of Dogs with Glasses
Welcome to the Memory Game of Dogs with Glasses! This is a fun and interactive game where you can test your memory skills and have fun at the same time. The game features a collection of adorable dogs wearing glasses, which adds a unique touch to the classic memory game.

## How to Play
The game is simple and easy to play. The game board is comprised of a grid of cards, each of which has a dog with glasses image on one side. The objective of the game is to find all the matching pairs of cards.

To start playing, simply click on any card to reveal its image. Then click on another card to reveal its image as well. If the images match, the cards will remain face up and you can move on to the next pair. If they do not match, the cards will be flipped over and you will need to try again.

The game ends when all the pairs have been found. Your final score is determined by the amount of time it takes you to complete the game. The faster you find all the matching pairs, the higher your score will be.
